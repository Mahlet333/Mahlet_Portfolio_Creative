    detailedDescription: "Developed an innovative diagnostic pipeline for Multiple Sclerosis, a complex neurological disease. The model integrates high-dimensional data from two distinct sources: brain MRI scans and gut microbiome sequencing. Using advanced deep learning architectures, the pipeline learns to identify subtle patterns indicative of MS. A key contribution was the integration of explainability (XAI) techniques, which allowed us to move beyond a 'black box' prediction and provide patient-level insights, highlighting the specific imaging features and microbial strains driving the diagnosis.",
