Semantic tags and ARIA attributes ensure accessibility and compliance with web standards.

#### 3.5.2 CSS Styling

The CSS framework utilizes Tailwind CSS 3.4.1 with custom animations and Flexbox/Grid layouts to deliver a responsive interface. Layouts structure content and interactive elements, enhanced by CSS transitions and transforms for smooth animations. Media queries at 768px breakpoints adapt designs, reflecting the cyberpunk theme with dark backgrounds and neon accents.

#### 3.5.3 JavaScript Functionality

React with TypeScript drives interactivity through a component-based architecture. Key features include state management, routing, and dynamic content rendering, supporting user interactions and data filtering. Optimizations ensure performance and efficiency through code splitting and lazy loading.

#### 3.5.4 Color Palette

The color scheme balances usability and mood, using high-contrast tones to guide interaction. Table 3 lists the primary colors with hex codes, supporting the cyberpunk aesthetic.
